    Theoretical Physicist and qBio enthusiast. Master's U. Milan, PhD AMOLF and U. Leiden, Postdoc Institut Curie, CNRS@Sorbonne, SPCG since 2018. I like models that guide the understanding of data and the development of new concepts and theories, such as Luria&Delbruck, Random Walk, and Fermi's liquid drop. I am also a big fan of scaling concepts in just about everything.

  description: >
    Physicist by training, I am broadly interested in biological questions. 
    Right now I am trying to understand how cells tune their growth strategy in response to perturbations. 
    My approach is quantitative, and sometimes I build models starting from experimental data, sometimes I use theoretical models to trigger new experiments.

  description: >
    Theoretical Physicist, cell-cycle guy. I like to address biological questions with tools borrowed from Statistical Physics and Probability Theory. One big question is how a cell decides to become two cells. Another big question is how this decision is coordinated with cell-growth.
