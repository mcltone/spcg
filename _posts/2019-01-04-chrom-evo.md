We work on evolutionary models that help us understand genome architecture. Our goal is to quantify the evolutionary forces that shape the structural variation of the genes and the genome, such as mutations and chromosome duplication, together with their effect on the reproductive fitness of the individuals. Recently, we have also set up a model that accounts for the aquisition and loss of DNA replication origins in Yeast.
