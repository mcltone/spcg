This post has a very light background image to test if it still renders nicely.

Things to remember here: cell growth as biophysics, cell growth at the level of biological regulation. Cell growth is driven by the interplay of physical process and biological regulation. We .. Cell growth is determined by a combination of .. Cell growth is constrained by physics and regulated by biology Rates of material accumulation are determined by physics and biologica regulation.. Circuit regulating growth affect biological function elsewhere... mechanistic picture (ppgpp, mTORc, ..) vs phenomenology, but also physics. Cell volume, cell mass, .. We aim to characterize what limits the rates of mass and volume accumulation/material accumulation. We aim to characterize the strategies for optimal growth rate control
