We work on quantitative models for cell growth, which help us understand how cells proliferate under different enviromental conditions. 
Our goal is to understand which regulatory circuits govers cells growth and how those circuits react to perturbations such as lack of nutrients or drug treatment. Our approach is both data and model driven: we make use of data provided from our experimental collaborators to build models, and we plan new experiments together to test the model predictions.
