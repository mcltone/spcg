Welcome to the Statistical Physics of Cells and Genomes Lab. Research in our group focuses on the development of theoretical models grounded on data and advanced model-guided data analysis to describe a broad range of biological phenomena. Some of our current principal research threads include questions on the physiology of cell growth and division across organisms, how chromosomes organize spatially inside the bacterial cell, the evolution of chromosomes including the emergence of aneuploidy, quantification of different mutation processes and phenotypic switches in mammalian cells.
